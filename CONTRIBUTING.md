# How to contribute to SourceAFIS matcher for FVC FV

Thank you for taking interest in SourceAFIS matcher for FVC FV. This document provides guidance for contributors.

## Authoritative repository

Sources are mirrored on several sites. You can submit issues and pull requests on any mirror.

* [sourceafis-fvc-fv-matcher @ GitHub](https://github.com/robertvazan/sourceafis-fvc-fv-matcher)
* [sourceafis-fvc-fv-matcher @ Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/robertvazan/sourceafis-fvc-fv-matcher)

## Issues

Both bug reports and feature requests are welcome. There is no free support,
but it's perfectly reasonable to open issues asking for more documentation or better usability.

## Pull requests

Pull requests are generally welcome.
If you would like to make large or controversial changes, open an issue first to discuss your idea.

Don't worry about formatting and naming too much. Code will be reformatted after merge.
Just don't run your formatter on whole source files, because it makes diffs hard to understand.

## Generated code

Some files in this repository are generated by [configure.py](scripts/configure.py),
which in turn uses author's personal [project-config](https://github.com/robertvazan/project-config) repository.
The intent is to enforce conventions and to reduce maintenance burden.
If you need to modify generated files, just do so manually and I will update `configure.py` after merge.
